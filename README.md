**Typing Speed Challenge** is an interactive web application that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy. Users are given a paragraph or line to type, and the application calculates their typing speed (Words Per Minute - WPM) and accuracy (%) in real-time. This project is built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js** and features a fully responsive design, making it accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It is perfect for users who want to improve their typing skills or enjoy a fun typing challenge.

## 🔹 Project Setup – React + Vite

This project uses **React** with **Vite** for a minimal and fast development setup with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint integration.

### Available Plugins
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react)** – Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) with rollup-vite) for Fast Refresh  
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc)** – Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh  

### React Compiler
The React Compiler is not enabled by default in this template due to its impact on development and build performance. To enable it, refer to [React Compiler documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).  

### Expanding ESLint Configuration
For production applications, it is recommended to use **TypeScript** with type-aware lint rules enabled. See the [TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on integrating TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
